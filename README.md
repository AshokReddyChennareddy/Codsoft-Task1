Overview
This is a simple rule-based chatbot project built in Python.
The chatbot is designed to respond to specific keywords and patterns found in user input, providing predefined responses. 
It cannot handle real-time tasks like fetching weather information but can respond to various basic queries and statements based on its programmed rules.

Features
Greets the user with "hello" or "hi."
Responds to common questions like "how are you," "your name," and "what time is it."
Offers simple small talk on topics such as food, movies, sports, and music.
Tells a joke or story if requested.
Can provide the current date and time.
Bids farewell when the user says "bye" or "goodbye."
Pattern-based responses using Python's re module (regex) for recognizing specific phrases.
Handles common gratitude expressions and offers assistance if asked for help.
Technologies Used
Python 3.x
Regular Expressions (regex): Used to search for patterns in user input.
Datetime module: Used to fetch the current date and time.
How It Works
User Input: The user types a message into the console.
Pattern Matching: The chatbot uses if-else conditions and regex patterns to detect key phrases like "hello," "time," "thank you," etc.
Predefined Responses: Based on the detected pattern, the chatbot responds with predefined messages.
Exit: When the user types "bye," the chatbot exits the conversation loop.
Example Conversations:
User: "Hi"

Chatbot: "Hello! How can I assist you today?"
User: "What is the time?"

Chatbot: "The current time is 14:45 PM."
User: "Tell me a joke."

Chatbot: "Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!"
User: "Goodbye"

Chatbot: "Goodbye! Have a great day ahead."

Code Breakdown
chatbot_response(user_input):
This function processes the user's input, converts it to lowercase for consistency, and checks for certain keywords or patterns.
It responds to greetings, requests for time, jokes, and more, using predefined responses.
It uses Python's re module to identify patterns like "weather," "thanks," or "time" in the user's input.
chatbot():
This is the main conversation loop.
It continuously asks for user input, processes the input using chatbot_response(), and prints the appropriate response.
The loop ends when the user types "bye."
Future Improvements
Add support for natural language processing (NLP) to handle more complex and varied user inputs.
Incorporate API integrations to provide real-time data like weather, news, and sports scores.
Implement a learning system to allow the chatbot to adapt and improve over time based on user interactions.
Expand the knowledge base to cover more topics and areas of interest.
